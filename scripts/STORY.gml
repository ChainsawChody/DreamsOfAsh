"Alright. So, no fixed point in a timeline, just Ash sleeping. Dragged into a corrupted memory that is 
created by the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis/Kandarian Demon because of the shit Ash did to the book. - In 
order to "break out" of the dream you have to overcome the corruption of shit he's gone through in the 
past, maybe fix something Ash feels he failed, save people he couldn't in rl, and in doing so, gain the 
mental fortitude to fight back, and burn the book/kill the demon within the dreamscape." - Forgefist
